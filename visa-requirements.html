            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Visa on Arrival Countries</h2>
                <p>Citizens from 68+ countries can get a free visa stamp upon arrival at UAE airports. No pre-application needed - just show up with your passport, return ticket, hotel booking, and proof of sufficient funds.</p>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>2025 Update:</strong> While visa-on-arrival countries remain largely unchanged, 107 countries now require pre-arranged visas (expanded in 2025 to include more African and South Asian nationalities). Check the Emirates airline visa tool for your specific country's requirements.
                </div>

                <h3>90-Day Visa on Arrival (Free)</h3>
                <p>The following regions get 90 days validity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Europe:</strong> All EU countries, UK, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland</li>
                    <li><strong>Americas:</strong> USA, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay</li>
                    <li><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>30-Day Visa on Arrival (Free)</h3>
                <p>These countries get 30 days validity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Asia:</strong> Andorra, Monaco, Hong Kong, China (with biometric passport)</li>
                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> Some nationalities may require sponsor or pre-approval</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're from a visa-on-arrival country, you can stay up to your visa validity, leave for 1 day to Oman or other nearby country, and return for another visa stamp. This is called a "visa run" and is commonly practiced.

            </div>

            <!-- Section 2: E-Visa Process -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>E-Visa Application Process</h2>
                <p>If your country doesn't qualify for visa on arrival, you'll need to apply for an e-visa before traveling. This is done through UAE airlines, hotels, or travel agencies who sponsor your application.</p>

                <h3>How to Apply</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Through airlines:</strong> Emirates, Etihad, and FlyDubai offer visa services when you book flights</li>
                    <li><strong>Through hotels:</strong> Many 4-5 star hotels can sponsor tourist visas</li>
                    <li><strong>Through agencies:</strong> Licensed travel agencies can process applications</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing time:</strong> Usually 3-5 business days, can be expedited for extra fee</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tourist Visa Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>30-day single entry:</strong> AED 350-450 (approx $95-120)</li>
                    <li><strong>30-day multiple entry:</strong> AED 650-750 (approx $175-200)</li>
                    <li><strong>60-day single entry:</strong> AED 750-900 (max duration per entry for some visas)</li>
                    <li><strong>90-day single entry:</strong> AED 1,000-1,200 (approx $270-325)</li>
                    <li><strong>90-day multiple entry:</strong> AED 1,800-2,000 (approx $490-545)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>2025 Note:</strong> Some visa categories now have a maximum of 60 days per entry rather than 90. Check specific requirements for your nationality when applying.
                </div>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Visa fees don't include service charges from sponsors. Total costs can be 20-30% higher when booked through agencies. Book directly through airlines for best rates.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Section 3: Required Documents -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Required Documents</h2>
                <p>Whether arriving with visa on arrival or pre-approved e-visa, you'll need these documents at immigration:</p>

                <h3>Essential Documents</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Passport:</strong> Valid for minimum 6 months from entry date. Must have at least 2 blank pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Return/onward ticket:</strong> Proof you're leaving UAE. Immigration may ask to see this.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hotel reservation:</strong> Confirmed booking for your stay. Can be cancellable, but must be confirmed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proof of sufficient funds (NEW 2025):</strong> Bank statement or cash showing AED 3,000 for 3-month visas or AED 5,000 for 2-month visas</li>
                    <li><strong>Travel insurance:</strong> Not mandatory but highly recommended. Some airlines require it.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Employment letter:</strong> May be requested for certain nationalities</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>2025 Important Update:</strong> Proof of financial means is now a standard requirement for UAE tourist visas. Have bank statements or sufficient cash available at immigration. This applies to both visa-on-arrival and pre-approved e-visa holders.
                </div>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep digital copies of all documents on your phone and in email. Immigration is increasingly accepting digital proof, especially for hotel bookings.

            <!-- Section 4: Visa Costs Breakdown -->

            <!-- Section 5: Extension Process -->

                <p>Need more time in paradise? Most tourist visas can be extended once for an additional 30 days. Here's how:</p>

                <h3>Extension Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Apply before expiry:</strong> Must apply at least 10 days before current visa expires</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> AED 600-850 (includes processing fees)</li>

                    <li>Bring passport, entry stamp copy, and passport photo</li>
                    <li>Pay fees (AED 600 extension + AED 50-100 typing service)</li>
                    <li>Receive new visa sticker in passport within 3-5 days</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> You can only extend once. After extension expires, you must leave UAE and cannot return on tourist visa for 30 days. Plan accordingly!

            <!-- Section 6: Common Mistakes to Avoid -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                <p>Learn from others' mistakes and save yourself headaches at immigration:</p>

                <h3>Passport Issues</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Less than 6 months validity:</strong> Airlines won't let you board, even if visa is approved</li>
                    <li><strong>Damaged passport:</strong> Even small tears or water damage can cause entry denial</li>
                    <li><strong>Insufficient pages:</strong> Need at least 2 blank pages for stamps</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Documentation Mistakes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No hotel booking:</strong> Immigration may deny entry without confirmed accommodation</li>
                    <li><strong>No return ticket:</strong> Proof of onward travel is mandatory for visa on arrival</li>
                    <li><strong>Wrong visa sponsor:</strong> If hotel sponsored your visa, you must actually stay there (at least first night)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Overstay Penalties</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First 30 days overstay:</strong> AED 125 per day fine + AED 100 service fee</li>
                    <li><strong>Beyond 30 days:</strong> Higher daily fines and possible travel ban</li>
                    <li><strong>6+ months overstay:</strong> Can result in deportation and 1-year entry ban</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Critical Warning:</strong> Overstaying your visa is taken very seriously. Set phone reminders for your exit date. If you realize you've overstayed, go to immigration immediately - the fines accumulate daily.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Section 7: What Happens at Immigration -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>What to Expect at Immigration</h2>
                <p>Understanding the arrival process helps you breeze through:</p>

                <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Biometric scan:</strong> Eye scan and photo taken at immigration counter</li>
                    <li><strong>Document check:</strong> Officer reviews passport, visa (if applicable), and hotel booking</li>
                    <li><strong>Questions (sometimes):</strong> Purpose of visit, where staying, how long</li>
                    <li><strong>Stamp:</strong> Entry stamp placed in passport with exit date</li>
                    <li><strong>Average time:</strong> 15-45 minutes depending on flight arrivals</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Red Flags That Cause Extra Scrutiny</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Traveling alone as young woman (rare, but can trigger questions)</li>
                    <li>No hotel booking or vague accommodation plans</li>
                    <li>Long-term stays without clear purpose</li>
                    <li>Previous overstay or violation history</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Have your documents ready in your hand before reaching immigration - passport, printed hotel booking, and return ticket. Be confident and friendly. The process is usually smooth if you have proper documentation.

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I apply for UAE visa if I have a criminal record?</h3>
                <p>It depends on the offense. Minor traffic violations are usually fine, but felonies, drug charges, or violent crimes may result in visa denial. UAE shares databases with many countries. Best to apply through official channels and disclose if asked.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I work on a tourist visa?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely not. Working on a tourist visa is illegal and can result in deportation, fines up to AED 50,000, and permanent entry ban. Even remote work for foreign companies is technically illegal, though rarely enforced if you're not obviously working.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do children need separate visas?</h3>
                <p>Yes, every person needs their own visa, regardless of age. However, children under 18 listed in parent's passport may get visa free or at reduced cost depending on nationality. Check with your airline or sponsor.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I convert tourist visa to work visa while in UAE?</h3>
                <p>Generally no. Most employment visas require you to exit the country for processing. However, some free zones allow tourist-to-employment visa conversion if you start a business. Consult an immigration lawyer for your specific situation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if my visa application is rejected?</h3>
                <p>Rejections are rare for legitimate tourists but can happen due to previous violations, shared names with wanted persons, or incomplete documentation. You can usually reapply with additional documents or explanation letter. Visa fees are typically non-refundable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is visa on arrival available at all UAE entry points?</h3>
                <p>Yes, visa on arrival is available at all international airports (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, etc.) and land borders. Sea ports also accept visa on arrival. The process is the same regardless of entry point.</p>
