üìù ANSWERS FOR CLAUDE CODE
Question 1: Hero Images
Answer:
"Use high-quality images from Unsplash for now. Find images that represent each emirate:

Dubai: Burj Khalifa skyline or Dubai Marina
Abu Dhabi: Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque or Emirates Palace
Sharjah: Heritage area or Sharjah Mosque
Ajman: Beach or corniche
Ras Al Khaimah: Jebel Jais mountains
Fujairah: Beach or Fujairah Fort
Umm Al Quwain: Water sports or traditional dhow boats

Use Unsplash search terms like 'Dubai skyline', 'Abu Dhabi mosque', 'Ras Al Khaimah mountains', etc. Make sure images are high-quality and at least 1920px wide. We can replace these with better images later if needed."

Question 2: Experience Cards Structure
Answer:
"YES - Check the homepage Experiences section and replicate the EXACT structure and styling.
Look at the HTML around line 224-435 where the experience cards are defined. Each experience card has:

<div class="experience-card"> wrapper
<div class="card-image-container"> with image
<div class="image-overlay-title"> with experience name
<div class="card-details"> with duration and button
Book button with onclick function

Use the same classes, same structure, same styling. The cards should look identical to the homepage experience cards - just filtered to show only experiences relevant to each emirate.
For example, on Dubai page, show:

Burj Khalifa (data-experience="burj-khalifa")
Theme Parks (data-experience="theme-parks")
Desert Safari (data-experience="desert-safari")
Skydiving (data-experience="skydiving")
Dubai Aquarium (data-experience="aquarium")
Luxury Yacht (data-experience="yacht")
Etc.

Match the exact experience slugs and onclick handlers from the homepage."

Question 3: Booking Function
Answer:
"YES - Check the existing script.js file to see how the bookExperience() function works. Use the EXACT same function calls.
From what I see in the HTML, the booking buttons use:
html<button class="book-btn purple" onclick="bookExperience('platinumlist', 'burj-khalifa')">Book</button>
The first parameter is the affiliate platform ('platinumlist'), the second is the experience slug.
For free experiences, the buttons use:
html<button class="book-btn green">Free</button>
Just replicate exactly what you see in the homepage experience cards. Don't create new functions - use the existing ones."

Question 4: Start With Which Tier?
Answer:
"Create all 7 at once using the same template structure. This is more efficient because:

The structure is identical for all 7 pages
Only differences are: emirate name, hero image, which experiences to show, word count
Easier to maintain consistent design across all pages
I can deploy and review all 7 together

Order of creation (for your workflow):

Create the template structure first
Then populate Dubai (most experiences, longest content)
Then Abu Dhabi (second most experiences)
Then the other 5 emirates (simpler, fewer experiences)

Content length guide:

Dubai & Abu Dhabi: 1,500-2,000 words, 10-12 experience cards
Sharjah, RAK, Fujairah: 800-1,000 words, 6-8 experience cards
Ajman, UAQ: 600-800 words, 4-6 experience cards

But deliver all 7 files together so I can review as a set."

"A few more notes:
Linking to homepage sections:

When linking to #booking (hotels), use: href="/#booking"
When linking to #dining (restaurants), use: href="/#dining"
When linking to #experiences, use: href="/#experiences"
These anchor links should scroll to the correct section on homepage

Experience cards to show per emirate:
Look at the existing experience cards and their data-category and data-experience attributes. Here's which experiences belong to which emirate:
Dubai experiences:

burj-khalifa
theme-parks
desert-safari
aquarium
yacht
skydiving
extreme-water
souk
jumeirah-beach
abra-ride
alseef-walk
marina-walk
alserkal-avenue
public-parks

Abu Dhabi experiences:

sheikh-zayed-mosque
louvre-abu-dhabi
yas-island

Other emirates:
Just show 3-4 general experiences (desert-safari, cultural sites, etc.) since we don't have emirate-specific ones yet. We can add more later.
FAQ Questions Template:
For each emirate, adapt these questions:

'How many days do you need in [Emirate]?'
'Is [Emirate] expensive?'
'What's [Emirate] best known for?'
'Is [Emirate] safe for tourists?'
'How far is [Emirate] from Dubai?' (skip for Dubai page)
'Is [Emirate] worth visiting?'

Write brief 2-3 sentence answers using your knowledge. We'll fact-check later.
