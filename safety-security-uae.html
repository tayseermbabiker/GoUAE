                <p>The UAE consistently ranks as one of the safest countries in the world. With extremely low crime rates, efficient law enforcement, and a tourist-friendly environment, visitors can feel secure throughout their stay.</p>

                    <li><strong>Petty theft:</strong> Uncommon but can happen in crowded tourist areas. Keep valuables secure</li>
                    <li><strong>Scams:</strong> Rare. Most taxi drivers, shop owners, and service providers are honest</li>
                    <li><strong>Pickpocketing:</strong> Very rare compared to European cities. Still, stay aware in busy malls and markets</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>

            <!-- Section 3: Health & Medical -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Healthcare & Medical Safety</h2>
                <p>UAE boasts excellent healthcare facilities with internationally trained doctors and modern equipment. However, medical care is expensive for those without insurance.</p>

                <h3>Healthcare Quality</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hospitals:</strong> World-class facilities, many JCI-accredited (international standard)</li>
                    <li><strong>Doctors:</strong> Internationally trained, many speak English fluently</li>
                    <li><strong>Pharmacies:</strong> Widely available, well-stocked, knowledgeable pharmacists</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical tourism:</strong> UAE is a destination for medical procedures due to high quality</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Major Hospitals</h3>

                    <li><strong>Dubai:</strong> Dubai Hospital, Rashid Hospital, American Hospital, Mediclinic</li>
                    <li><strong>Abu Dhabi:</strong> Cleveland Clinic, Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, NMC Royal Hospital</li>
                    <li><strong>Sharjah:</strong> University Hospital Sharjah, Al Qassimi Hospital</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Health Considerations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Heat:</strong> Summer temperatures 40-50°C (104-122°F). Heat stroke risk is real</li>
                    <li><strong>Sun exposure:</strong> Very intense sun year-round. Sunscreen essential (SPF 50+)</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink water constantly, especially if outdoors</li>
                    <li><strong>Air conditioning:</strong> Can cause cold symptoms from temperature shifts</li>
                    <li><strong>Food safety:</strong> Generally excellent. Restaurants follow strict hygiene standards</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Travel Insurance - ESSENTIAL</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Medical costs:</strong> Can be AED 500-1,500 for simple consultation without insurance</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency surgery:</strong> Can cost AED 50,000-200,000+ without coverage</li>
                    <li><strong>Ambulance:</strong> AED 1,500-3,000 per trip without insurance</li>
                    <li><strong>Get insurance that covers:</strong> Medical emergencies, evacuation, trip cancellation</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Do NOT skip travel insurance for UAE. While healthcare is excellent, it's extremely expensive without coverage. A simple hospital visit can cost what you paid for your entire trip.

                <h2>Safety for Women Travelers</h2>
                <p>UAE is considered one of the safest countries for solo women travelers. Harassment is rare and taken seriously by authorities.</p>

                <h3>What Makes UAE Safe for Women</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low harassment rates:</strong> Catcalling and street harassment are uncommon</li>
                    <li><strong>Strict laws:</strong> Harassment carries severe penalties including jail time and deportation</li>
                    <li><strong>Women-only spaces:</strong> Ladies' taxis, metro cars, beach sections available</li>
                    <li><strong>Night safety:</strong> Safe to walk alone at night in tourist areas</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Practical Tips for Women</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dress modestly</strong> outside beach resorts (covered shoulders, knees covered)</li>
                    <li><strong>Use ladies' metro car</strong> during rush hours if uncomfortable in mixed cars</li>
                    <li><strong>Request ladies' taxi</strong> - pink roof lights indicate women-only cabs</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust your instincts</strong> - if something feels wrong, leave or call for help</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid isolated areas</strong> late at night, as you would anywhere</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>If You Experience Harassment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Report immediately to police (999) - they take it seriously</li>
                    <li>Shopping malls have security who will help immediately</li>

                    <li>Take photos/videos if safe to do so for evidence</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Many solo female travelers report UAE feels safer than their home countries. The combination of cultural conservatism and strict law enforcement creates a secure environment. That said, normal travel safety practices still apply.

                <h2>Staying Legally Safe</h2>

                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Download weather apps and check forecasts daily. Summer heat is not to be underestimated - tourists have died from heat stroke. If you feel dizzy or nauseous in the heat, get into air conditioning immediately and drink water.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is Dubai safe for solo female travelers?</h3>
                <p>Yes, Dubai and UAE are among the safest destinations for solo female travelers worldwide. Harassment is rare and taken seriously by police. Women can walk alone at night in tourist areas, use public transport safely, and generally feel very secure. That said, dress modestly outside beach resorts and follow normal travel safety practices.</p>

                <h3>What should I do if I lose my passport in UAE?</h3>
                <p>Report immediately to local police to get a police report. Then contact your embassy/consulate in UAE (Abu Dhabi or Dubai) to get emergency travel documents. You'll need the police report, passport photos, and identification. Process usually takes 1-3 days. Keep photocopies of your passport separate from original.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I drink tap water in UAE?</h3>
                <p>Yes, tap water is safe to drink and meets international safety standards. However, it's desalinated seawater and may taste different than you're used to. Most residents and tourists prefer bottled water for taste rather than safety reasons. Restaurants serve tap water unless you request bottled.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens if I get sick and need a doctor?</h3>
                <p>Go to any hospital emergency room or private clinic. You'll receive excellent care but must pay upfront or show travel insurance. Emergency rooms accept walk-ins 24/7. For non-emergencies, private clinics offer same-day appointments. Hotel concierges can recommend English-speaking doctors. Cost without insurance: AED 500-1,500 for consultation.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are there areas I should avoid in Dubai or Abu Dhabi?</h3>
                <p>UAE cities don't have "dangerous neighborhoods" like many Western cities. All areas are generally safe. However, some older areas (like certain parts of Deira or Bur Dubai) can feel less tourist-friendly late at night - not dangerous, just less comfortable. Industrial areas away from tourist zones are also worth avoiding simply because there's nothing to do there.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What should I do if police stop me?</h3>
                <p>Be polite, respectful, and cooperative. Have your passport or ID ready. Police are professional and usually speak English. Don't argue or be defensive. If detained, request to contact your embassy immediately - this is your legal right. Most police interactions are routine checks and quick. Serious issues are rare for tourists following the law.</p>
