                <h2>UAE Climate Overview</h2>
                <p>The UAE has a subtropical desert climate characterized by extremely hot summers, warm winters, and very little rainfall. Understanding the seasonal variations helps you plan the perfect trip.</p>

                <h3>Climate Characteristics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Desert climate:</strong> Hot and dry year-round with minimal rainfall</li>
                    <li><strong>High humidity:</strong> Coastal areas (Dubai, Abu Dhabi) very humid, especially summer</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal rainfall:</strong> Average 5-10 rainy days per year, mostly in winter</li>
                    <li><strong>Intense sun:</strong> UV index very high year-round, sun protection essential</li>
                    <li><strong>Air conditioning:</strong> Everywhere indoors is heavily air-conditioned (18-20°C)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Two Main Seasons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Winter (November-March):</strong> Pleasant 20-30°C days, cool evenings, perfect outdoor weather</li>
                    <li><strong>Summer (May-September):</strong> Extreme heat 40-50°C, high humidity, challenging for tourists</li>
                    <li><strong>Transition months:</strong> April and October are warm but manageable</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> UAE weather is predictable. Unlike temperate climates, you can book 6 months ahead knowing exactly what weather to expect. December trip? It will be perfect 25°C. August trip? It will be brutally hot 45°C. This predictability helps trip planning enormously.

                <div class="tip-box">

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Does it ever rain in UAE?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but rarely. UAE gets 5-10 rainy days per year, mostly in December-March. When it does rain, it's usually brief showers. Occasional heavy rain causes flooding because the infrastructure isn't built for it and desert soil doesn't absorb water well. Bring light rain jacket in winter if you want to be prepared, but unlikely you'll need it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I sunbathe year-round in UAE?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but summer (May-September) is dangerously hot. Beach is enjoyable November-April with perfect tanning weather. Summer sunbathing is possible early morning (before 10am) or evening (after 5pm) but midday sun can cause severe burns in 15-20 minutes. Sea temperature stays warm year-round (24-33°C) so swimming is always possible if you can handle the air temperature.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the best month for families with kids?</h3>
                <p>December-February or November-March for school-age kids during winter break. Avoid summer unless children are very heat-tolerant. Late October-November or March-April offer good balance of decent weather and fewer crowds. January-February can be busy with school holidays worldwide.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is it worth visiting UAE in summer to save money?</h3>
                <p>Depends on your heat tolerance and travel style. If you're comfortable staying indoors during peak heat (11am-5pm), shopping, dining, and enjoying hotel facilities, you can save 50-60% on accommodation. Not recommended for: first-time visitors, families with young kids, elderly travelers, or anyone wanting outdoor sightseeing. Good for: budget travelers, mall enthusiasts, indoor activity fans.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need warm clothes for UAE winter?</h3>
                <p>Light jacket or cardigan is enough. Daytime is warm (24-28°C) but evenings can cool to 14-18°C, especially near coast with sea breeze. Indoor spaces are heavily air-conditioned year-round (18-20°C) so light long sleeves useful. No need for winter coat, scarf, or gloves except maybe for young children sensitive to AC.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How accurate are weather forecasts for UAE?</h3>
                <p>Very accurate and consistent. UAE weather is extremely predictable due to desert climate and lack of weather systems that create variability. If forecast says sunny and 32°C, it will almost certainly be sunny and 32°C. This makes trip planning easy - you can book months ahead knowing exactly what weather to expect.</p>
