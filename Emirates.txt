Hi Claude Code,
Time to create the Emirates pages. I've refined the structure after reviewing our existing content.
What We Already Have:
‚úÖ 50 hotels organized in 5 categories (Beachfront, Downtown, Business, Family, Budget)
‚úÖ Restaurants organized in 4 categories (Fine Dining, International, Local & Emirati, Scenic Views)
‚úÖ 20+ experiences with booking buttons (Desert Safari, Burj Khalifa, Theme Parks, etc.)
‚úÖ Info pages covering practical topics (visa, alcohol, transportation, currency, etc.)
So the Emirates pages should NOT duplicate any of this. Instead, they should LINK to these existing sections strategically.

Create These 7 Emirates Pages:

dubai-travel-guide.html (1,500-2,000 words)
abu-dhabi-travel-guide.html (1,500-2,000 words)
sharjah-travel-guide.html (800-1,000 words)
ajman-travel-guide.html (600-800 words)
ras-al-khaimah-travel-guide.html (800-1,000 words)
fujairah-travel-guide.html (800-1,000 words)
umm-al-quwain-travel-guide.html (500-700 words)


Page Structure (Same for All):
Section 1: Hero

Beautiful hero image of the emirate
Emirate name as H1
Short tagline

Section 2: TL;DR Box

"‚ö° Quick Summary" heading
4 bullet points:

What makes this emirate special in one sentence
Who it's best for (families/solo/adventure/culture)
Recommended days to spend
Must-see highlights (2-3 items max)



Section 3: Why Visit [Emirate Name]

3-4 paragraphs (200-400 words total)
Tell a story about what makes THIS emirate unique
NOT a list of attractions, but the VIBE and CHARACTER
Write like a local giving advice to a Western friend
Focus on the experience and feeling, not just facts

Example for Dubai:
"Dubai isn't just a city - it's an experience that defies expectations. Where else can you ski indoors in the morning and beach-hop in the afternoon..."
Section 4: Top [Emirate] Experiences ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT SECTION
This is where we drive bookings. Show experience cards from our existing Experiences section:

Heading: "üéØ Top [Emirate] Experiences"
Subheading: "Book these experiences through our trusted partners"
Display 8-12 experience cards IN A GRID (same style as homepage experiences section)
Each card shows: Image, Experience name, Duration, "Book Now" button
The "Book Now" button links to: onclick="bookExperience('platinumlist', 'experience-slug')"
Only show experiences relevant to THIS emirate

For Dubai, show: Burj Khalifa, Desert Safari, Theme Parks, Skydiving, Aquarium, Yacht, etc.
For Abu Dhabi, show: Grand Mosque, Louvre, Yas Island, etc.

Design Requirements:

Match the existing site design (same colors, fonts, spacing)
Use the same purple/indigo gradient colors
Mobile-first responsive design
Experience cards should look IDENTICAL to homepage experience cards

Add proper spacing between sections
Include hero images for each emirate


Update Emirates Section on Homepage:
Change the "Explore" buttons on the 7 emirate cards to link to these new pages:

Dubai card ‚Üí /dubai-travel-guide.html
Abu Dhabi card ‚Üí /abu-dhabi-travel-guide.html
etc.


Content Note:
For the "Why Visit [Emirate]" section and FAQ answers, use placeholder/draft content. Focus on creating the perfect structure. The content will be fact-checked and improved later.

Key Point:
The goal of these pages is to:

Tell the story of each emirate (Why Visit section)
Drive experience bookings (Top Experiences section) ‚≠ê MAIN GOAL
Drive hotel bookings (Where to Stay links)
Provide quick practical info (with links to detailed pages)

We're not duplicating content - we're creating strategic funnels to our monetization points.
