            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I drink water in public during Ramadan if I'm not Muslim?</h3>
                <p>No, drinking water in public during daylight hours is not allowed for anyone, including tourists. This is law enforced with fines. You must go to private space (hotel room, curtained restaurant area, your car) to drink water. While this seems strict, it's temporary and shows respect to those fasting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do all restaurants close during day in Ramadan?</h3>
                <p>Most public restaurants close during daylight hours. However, many hotels serve food to non-Muslim guests in screened or curtained areas. Some food courts in malls also operate behind curtains. Fast food delivery services also continue. You won't starve, but choices are limited during day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I still go to the beach during Ramadan?</h3>
                <p>Yes, beaches remain open. However, you cannot eat or drink on public beach during fasting hours. Hotel beaches and pools are fine - you can eat and drink in these private areas. Just be extra modest with beach attire and cover up more than usual when leaving beach area.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Will Dubai be boring during Ramadan?</h3>
                <p>Not at all, just different schedule. Days are quieter, but evenings and nights are vibrant and festive. Ramadan nights can be busier than regular times. Cities come alive after Iftar with special events, night markets, and celebrations. It's different pace but not boring if you adjust schedule accordingly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens if I accidentally eat in public during Ramadan?</h3>
                <p>If it's genuine mistake and you're polite, you'll likely get warning from police or security. Stop immediately, apologize, and put food away. Fines are usually for deliberate violations or if you're rude when confronted. As tourist, educational warning more common than fine, but fines are possible (AED 2,000).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I exercise outdoors during Ramadan?</h3>
                <p>Yes, outdoor exercise is allowed during Ramadan. However, be extra careful about hydration - you cannot drink water in public. Exercise early morning or late evening when cooler. Most serious athletes exercise in gym during Ramadan where they can hydrate privately. Don't risk heat-related illness.</p>
