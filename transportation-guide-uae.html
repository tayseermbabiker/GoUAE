                    <li><strong>Careem:</strong> Regional app (owned by Uber), very popular, slightly cheaper than Uber usually. Accepts cash!</li>
                    <li><strong>Hala (RTA):</strong> Official Dubai taxi app. Books regular taxis through app. No surge pricing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment:</strong> All apps accept card. Careem also accepts cash. Uber UAE now accepts cash too.</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>

                <h3>Tipping</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not expected but appreciated:</strong> Round up to nearest AED 5 or 10</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Fare is AED 47, give AED 50 and say "keep the change"</li>

                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">

                <h2>Airport Transfers</h2>
                <p>Getting to/from airports efficiently sets the tone for your trip. Here are your options:</p>

                <h3>Dubai International Airport (DXB)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Metro:</strong> Red Line connects Terminal 1 & 3. AED 5-7 to most destinations. Best value!</li>
                    <li><strong>RTA Taxi:</strong> AED 25 base fare + distance. To Marina: AED 70-90, to Downtown: AED 50-60</li>
                    <li><strong>Uber/Careem:</strong> Similar to taxi prices, pickup from designated rideshare areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Hotel shuttle:</strong> Many 4-5 star hotels offer free/paid shuttle. Check when booking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pre-booked transfer:</strong> AED 100-150 for private car, good if arriving late night</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Al Maktoum Airport (DWC)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Near Jebel Ali, far from city center (60 km to Dubai Marina)</li>
                    <li><strong>Taxi only option:</strong> No metro. Taxi to Marina AED 100-130, to Downtown AED 120-150</li>
                    <li><strong>Less convenient:</strong> Factor in extra travel time and cost</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Abu Dhabi Airport (AUH)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bus to city:</strong> A1 bus to downtown Abu Dhabi. AED 4, 30-45 mins</li>
                    <li><strong>Taxi within Abu Dhabi:</strong> AED 60-100 to most hotels</li>
                    <li><strong>Taxi to Dubai:</strong> AED 300-350, negotiate before departure</li>
                    <li><strong>Bus to Dubai:</strong> Must get to Abu Dhabi bus station first, then take E100/E101. Total 3+ hours.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sharjah Airport (SHJ)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smaller airport:</strong> Used by budget airlines, closer to Dubai than you'd think</li>
                    <li><strong>Taxi to Dubai:</strong> AED 90-120 depending on destination</li>
                    <li><strong>Bus to Sharjah center:</strong> Then connect to Dubai bus</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If arriving at DXB with lots of luggage or traveling with family, metro might not be ideal despite being cheap. A taxi or Uber for AED 50-70 is worth the comfort. If solo and traveling light, metro is unbeatable value.

                <h2>Money-Saving Transportation Tips</h2>

                <h3>Combine Methods Strategically</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Metro + short taxi:</strong> Take metro to nearest station, then AED 15-20 taxi to final destination</li>
                    <li><strong>Walk when possible:</strong> Dubai Marina, JBR, Downtown Dubai are walkable areas (early morning/evening)</li>
                    <li><strong>Share rides:</strong> Uber/Careem allow shared rides (UberX Share, Careem GO Share) for 20-30% savings</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Timing Matters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoid rush hours:</strong> 7-9 AM and 5-8 PM traffic can double journey times</li>
                    <li><strong>Book taxis in advance:</strong> Hala app allows booking without surge pricing</li>
                    <li><strong>Metro during sales/events:</strong> When roads are gridlocked during Dubai Shopping Festival, metro is king</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Weekly/Monthly Passes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Staying 7+ days:</strong> Consider Nol monthly pass if using metro daily</li>
                    <li><strong>Day pass:</strong> AED 20 unlimited metro/bus for day trips</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is it safe to use Uber/Careem in UAE?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely yes. Both are very safe and widely used by tourists and residents. Drivers are vetted, cars are tracked, and the apps have safety features. UAE has extremely low crime rates, making ride-hailing very safe even late at night.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I use my home country driver's license?</h3>
                <p>Depends on nationality. US, UK, most EU countries, Canada, Australia, and several others can drive with their home license + IDP (International Driving Permit). Some countries' licenses are accepted without IDP. Check with rental company. Most tourists should get IDP before traveling - it's cheap and easy from your home country's automobile association.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I know if I got a speeding fine?</h3>
                <p>Speeding fines typically show up 3-7 days after the violation. For rental cars, the company checks your license plate before you return the car. They'll charge your credit card for fines + AED 20-50 admin fee per fine. You can check fines yourself at Dubai Police website or MOI app using rental car plate number.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is Dubai Metro really crowded?</h3>
                <p>During rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-8 PM), regular class can be very crowded - standing room only. Outside rush hours, it's quite comfortable. Gold Class is never crowded. Weekends are busier in evenings (mall time). Overall, it's manageable and still worth using for the cost savings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I take a taxi from Dubai to Abu Dhabi and back?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but expensive. Dubai taxis can drop you in Abu Dhabi, but cannot pick up passengers there for return - they must return empty. This means you pay for round trip even one-way. Total cost around AED 500-600. Better to take bus (AED 50 round trip) or rent a car (AED 100/day + fuel).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the best way to get around if I'm only visiting for 2-3 days?</h3>
                <p>For short stays in Dubai, combination of metro + Uber/Careem is ideal. Metro for major attractions (Dubai Mall, Mall of Emirates, Marina), Uber for specific destinations metro doesn't reach. Budget AED 60-100/day for transport. This gives you flexibility without the commitment of renting a car.</p>
