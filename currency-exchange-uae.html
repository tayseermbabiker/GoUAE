            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>UAE Currency Basics</h2>
                <p>The UAE Dirham (AED) is the official currency. Understanding the denominations, exchange rates, and where to get the best value helps you manage money efficiently during your trip.</p>

                    <li><strong>AED 200:</strong> Brown/green (common)</li>
                    <li><strong>AED 500:</strong> Blue (less common, some small shops may refuse)</li>
                    <li><strong>AED 1000:</strong> Purple (rare, often refused by taxis and small shops)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Coins</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1 Dirham:</strong> Silver coin, useful for small purchases</li>
                    <li><strong>50 Fils:</strong> Smaller silver coin, rarely used</li>
                    <li><strong>25 Fils:</strong> Even smaller, almost extinct</li>
                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> Most transactions round to nearest dirham, fils barely used</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Approximate Exchange Rates (As of 2024)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>US Dollar:</strong> 1 USD = 3.67 AED (fixed)</li>
                    <li><strong>Euro:</strong> 1 EUR = 4.00 AED (fluctuates)</li>
                    <li><strong>British Pound:</strong> 1 GBP = 4.65 AED (fluctuates)</li>
                    <li><strong>Canadian Dollar:</strong> 1 CAD = 2.70 AED (fluctuates)</li>
                    <li><strong>Australian Dollar:</strong> 1 AUD = 2.40 AED (fluctuates)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Since AED is pegged to USD, American travelers have the advantage of a fixed, predictable exchange rate. For other currencies, check current rates before traveling but expect them to stay fairly stable during your trip.

            <!-- Section 2: Where to Exchange Money -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Where to Exchange Money</h2>
                <p>Multiple options exist for getting dirhams, each with different rates and convenience levels. Knowing which to use saves you money.</p>

                <h3>Best Option: ATM Withdrawal</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rate:</strong> Best exchange rate, close to official bank rate</li>
                    <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Your bank's international withdrawal fee (usually 1-3%)</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> ATMs everywhere - malls, airports, hotels, streets</li>
                    <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> 24/7 access, withdraw as needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Withdraw larger amounts to minimize per-transaction fees</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Good Option: Currency Exchange Shops</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rate:</strong> Competitive, shop around for best rate</li>
                    <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Usually no commission, rate includes their margin</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Malls, souks, shopping areas, airports</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommended chains:</strong> Al Ansari Exchange, UAE Exchange, Al Rostamani</li>
                    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid airport exchanges if possible, rates 3-5% worse than city shops</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Okay Option: Hotels</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rate:</strong> Poor, usually 5-10% worse than market rate</li>
                    <li><strong>Fees:</strong> May charge commission on top of bad rate</li>
                    <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Very convenient, open 24/7</li>
                    <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Emergency only or very small amounts</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Avoid: Airport Currency Exchange (Arrival)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rate:</strong> Worst rates, 5-8% worse than city</li>
                    <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Exchange just enough for taxi/immediate needs (AED 100-200)</li>
                    <li><strong>Better approach:</strong> Use ATM in airport arrivals area instead</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Home Country Exchange (Before Travel)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rate:</strong> Usually poor unless you have good bank relationship</li>
                    <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Arrive with cash ready</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Only exchange small amount for arrival, get rest in UAE</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Money Saving Tip:</strong> Best strategy is ATM + credit cards. Withdraw AED 1,000-2,000 from ATM upon arrival for cash needs (taxis, small purchases, tips). Use credit card everywhere else. This combination gives you best rates and maximum convenience.

            <!-- Section 3: Credit Cards & Payment Methods -->

                </ul>

                <h3>Where Cards Work</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hotels:</strong> Always, often require card for incidentals</li>
                    <li><strong>Restaurants:</strong> All accept cards, even small cafes</li>
                    <li><strong>Shops & Malls:</strong> Universal acceptance</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Where You Need Cash</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Small independent shops:</strong> In souks or old areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Street vendors:</strong> Food carts, small stalls</li>
                    <li><strong>Tips:</strong> Cash tips preferred though some allow card tipping</li>
                    <li><strong>Some taxis:</strong> Older taxis may not have card readers</li>
                    <li><strong>Traditional markets:</strong> Gold souk, spice souk vendors</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Digital Wallets</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Apple Pay:</strong> Widely accepted, works with contactless terminals</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Pay:</strong> Similarly accepted</li>
                    <li><strong>Samsung Pay:</strong> Works but less common</li>
                    <li><strong>Local apps:</strong> Careem Pay, Beam Wallet gaining popularity</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Credit Card Fees to Watch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Foreign transaction fees:</strong> 1-3% charged by many credit cards</li>
                    <li><strong>Get fee-free card:</strong> Many travel cards have no foreign transaction fees</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic currency conversion:</strong> When asked "charge in your home currency?" always say NO - choose AED for better rate</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Always decline dynamic currency conversion when paying by card. If terminal or receipt shows your home currency (USD, EUR, etc.), you're being overcharged 3-5%. Always insist on paying in AED - your card network gives better exchange rates than merchants.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Section 4: ATMs & Banking -->

                    <li>Check for card skimmers (though very rare in UAE)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Emirates NBD ATMs are most reliable and have good English interfaces. Located in every mall and major area. Their ATMs clearly show any fees before you confirm withdrawal, letting you cancel if needed.

            <!-- Section 5: Tipping Guide -->

                <h2>Tipping in UAE</h2>
                <p>Tipping is not mandatory in UAE but appreciated for good service. Understanding local tipping customs helps you navigate gracefully.</p>

                <h3>When NOT to Tip</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fast food restaurants (McDonald's, KFC, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Shops and retail stores</li>
                    <li>Gas station attendants (fuel is full-service but tip not expected)</li>
                    <li>Government services</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Cultural Note:</strong> Service workers in UAE often come from South Asia, Philippines, and other countries where wages are modest. Tips significantly help these workers. While not mandatory, tipping good service is appreciated and makes a real difference to service staff.

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I exchange money before arriving in UAE?</h3>
                <p>Only exchange a small amount (equivalent of AED 100-200) for taxi and immediate needs. You'll get better rates using ATMs in UAE. Airport arrivals area has ATMs immediately after customs - use these instead of currency exchange counters which have poor rates.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I use US Dollars in UAE?</h3>
                <p>Not commonly accepted. UAE is a dirham economy - you need AED for purchases. Some hotels and luxury shops might accept USD but at very poor exchange rates. Use ATM to get dirhams or pay by credit card for best value.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much cash should I carry daily?</h3>
                <p>AED 200-300 is plenty for a day. Most places accept cards, but cash useful for taxis, tips, small purchases, and souks. Carry less if you're mainly in malls and restaurants where cards work everywhere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is it safe to carry large amounts of cash?</h3>
                <p>Yes, UAE is very safe with low crime rates. That said, no need to carry large amounts - ATMs are everywhere so withdraw as needed. Keep larger amounts in hotel safe if you must carry lots of cash.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are prices negotiable in UAE?</h3>
                <p>In traditional souks (gold, spice, textiles), absolutely - bargaining expected. Start at 50-60% of asking price. In malls, hotels, restaurants, and modern shops, prices are fixed and non-negotiable. Rarely, older independent shops may give small discount if you ask politely.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I get VAT refund as tourist?</h3>
                <p>Yes! UAE has 5% VAT. Tourists can get refund on purchases over AED 250 from participating stores. Get Tax Free Form from store, keep receipts, claim refund at airport before check-in. Usually receive refund to credit card within 7-10 days. Worth doing for expensive purchases.</p>
