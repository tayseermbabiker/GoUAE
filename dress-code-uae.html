            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>General Dress Code Principles</h2>
                <p>UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, balances Islamic values with international cosmopolitan culture. Understanding this balance helps you dress appropriately while staying comfortable.</p>

                <h3>The Golden Rule</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Respect + Common Sense:</strong> Dress as you would visiting a conservative relative</li>
                    <li><strong>When in doubt, cover up:</strong> Better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed</li>
                    <li><strong>Different areas, different standards:</strong> Tourist zones more relaxed than local neighborhoods</li>
                    <li><strong>Context matters:</strong> Beach vs mosque vs mall require different dress levels</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What "Modest Dress" Means</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cover shoulders:</strong> No tank tops, spaghetti straps, or strapless tops in public</li>
                    <li><strong>Cover knees:</strong> Shorts, skirts, dresses should reach at least mid-thigh or longer</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid see-through:</strong> Clothing should not be transparent or too tight</li>
                    <li><strong>No offensive graphics:</strong> Avoid clothing with profanity, controversial symbols, or religious imagery</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Enforcement Reality</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rarely enforced:</strong> Police won't approach tourists for dress code violations except extreme cases</li>
                    <li><strong>Social pressure:</strong> Stares, comments, or disapproving looks more common than official action</li>
                    <li><strong>Malls have rules:</strong> Security may ask you to cover up or leave if dress deemed inappropriate</li>
                    <li><strong>Fines possible:</strong> Technically can be fined or deported for "indecent" dress but rare for tourists</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Carry a light scarf or cardigan in your bag. It's useful for overly air-conditioned spaces AND if you need to cover up unexpectedly. This simple item solves most dress code concerns.

                <h3>What Works Well</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Maxi dresses:</strong> Perfect for UAE - modest, cool, stylish</li>
                    <li><strong>Wide-leg pants:</strong> Comfortable in heat, appropriate everywhere</li>
                    <li><strong>Light cardigans:</strong> Throw over tank tops for instant modesty</li>
                    <li><strong>Midi skirts:</strong> Below knee, flowy fabrics work great</li>
                    <li><strong>Linen clothing:</strong> Breathable and naturally modest</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Avoid</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Very short shorts/skirts:</strong> Above mid-thigh attracts stares</li>
                    <li><strong>Crop tops:</strong> Showing midriff not appropriate in public</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-cut tops:</strong> Excessive cleavage frowned upon</li>
                    <li><strong>See-through fabrics:</strong> Without proper undergarments</li>
                    <li><strong>Leggings as pants:</strong> Wear tunic/long shirt over them</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cultural Clothing Appreciation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abaya:</strong> Traditional black robe, not required for tourists</li>
                    <li><strong>Trying one:</strong> Can buy or rent to try, but unnecessary</li>
                    <li><strong>Respectful:</strong> Some women wear abaya out of respect, but locals don't expect it</li>
                    <li><strong>Practical:</strong> Actually very comfortable in heat, covers everything easily</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Important for Women:</strong> While Dubai/Abu Dhabi are cosmopolitan, you may receive unwanted attention if dressed very revealingly. Modest dress not only shows respect but also reduces uncomfortable situations. When in doubt, err on side of modesty.

                <h2>Dressing for UAE Climate</h2>

                <h3>Summer Dress Strategy (May-September)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lightest fabrics possible:</strong> Cotton, linen, moisture-wicking synthetics</li>
                    <li><strong>Loose-fitting:</strong> Allows air circulation, cooler than tight clothes</li>
                    <li><strong>Light colors:</strong> Reflect heat better than dark colors</li>
                    <li><strong>Sun protection:</strong> Light long sleeves actually cooler than sun-exposed skin</li>
                    <li><strong>Wide-brim hats:</strong> Essential sun protection</li>
                    <li><strong>Breathable footwear:</strong> Sandals with good support</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Winter Dress Strategy (November-March)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Layer system:</strong> T-shirt base, light cardigan for evenings</li>
                    <li><strong>Still warm days:</strong> 24-28°C daytime, summer clothes work</li>
                    <li><strong>Cool evenings:</strong> 14-18°C, light jacket or sweater needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Beach days:</strong> Still perfect weather for swimwear</li>
                    <li><strong>Indoor AC:</strong> Always cold, layers essential year-round</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Footwear Advice</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comfortable walking shoes:</strong> Essential for mall and sightseeing days</li>
                    <li><strong>Sandals:</strong> Easy to slip off for mosque visits, hotel entries</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid white shoes:</strong> Sand and dust make them dirty quickly</li>
                    <li><strong>Closed-toe for desert:</strong> Sand gets very hot, protect feet</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Fabric Tip:</strong> Invest in moisture-wicking, quick-dry fabrics if visiting in summer. Traditional cotton becomes heavy and uncomfortable when sweaty. Athletic/travel fabrics designed for heat perform much better in UAE climate.

                <h2>Cultural Sensitivity & Respect</h2>

                <h3>Understanding Local Dress</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Emirati men wear:</strong> White kandura (long white robe) and ghutra (white head cloth)</li>
                    <li><strong>Emirati women wear:</strong> Black abaya (robe) and shayla (head covering)</li>

                    <li><strong>Shows respect:</strong> Modest dress acknowledges their values</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Dress Code Matters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Islamic values:</strong> Modesty is important religious and cultural principle</li>

                    <li><strong>Hospitality reciprocity:</strong> Emiratis are hospitable; modest dress reciprocates respect</li>
                    <li><strong>Better experience:</strong> Respectful dress results in warmer interactions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ramadan Considerations</h3>

                    <li><strong>Extra modest:</strong> During Ramadan, dress even more conservatively</li>
                    <li><strong>Cover more skin:</strong> Full-length pants, long sleeves preferred</li>
                    <li><strong>Less tolerant:</strong> Authorities and locals less patient with revealing dress during holy month</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Photography Etiquette</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Never photograph Emirati women:</strong> Without explicit permission, very disrespectful</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask men too:</strong> Polite to ask permission before photographing anyone</li>
                    <li><strong>Government buildings:</strong> Don't photograph, illegal in many cases</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Cultural Insight:</strong> Many Emiratis appreciate when tourists make effort to dress modestly. It shows you've done research and respect their culture. Small effort goes long way in creating positive interactions and experiences.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I wear shorts in Dubai as a woman?</h3>
                <p>Yes, knee-length or longer shorts are acceptable in tourist areas, malls, and casual settings. Very short shorts (above mid-thigh) may attract stares and could be deemed inappropriate in malls. Longer shorts are safer choice and still comfortable in the heat.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I have to cover my head as a female tourist?</h3>
                <p>No, headscarves not required for non-Muslim women except when entering mosques. Even in mosques that allow non-Muslim visitors, they usually provide scarves. In general public, you never need to cover your head as tourist.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I wear a bikini at hotel pool?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely yes. Hotel pools and beaches are considered private spaces where Western swimwear is completely normal and expected. Bikinis, one-pieces, swim trunks all perfectly acceptable. Just cover up when leaving hotel property to walk on public streets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What should I wear to Burj Khalifa observation deck?</h3>
                <p>Smart casual is appropriate. Cover shoulders and knees - this means no tank tops, short shorts, or beach attire. Regular tourist clothing (t-shirt and pants/knee-length shorts) is fine. It's indoors and air-conditioned, so dress comfortably but respectfully.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are ripped jeans okay in UAE?</h3>
                <p>Depends on extent of ripping and location. Lightly distressed jeans generally fine in casual settings. Heavily ripped with lots of skin showing may be problematic in malls or get you refused at clubs. Better to bring regular jeans to avoid any issues.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can unmarried couples hold hands in public?</h3>
                <p>In tourist areas of Dubai/Abu Dhabi, yes - hand-holding is generally tolerated. Anything beyond that (kissing, embracing) can lead to arrest. In more conservative areas or emirates (like Sharjah), even hand-holding may attract disapproval. Play it safe and keep PDA minimal.</p>
